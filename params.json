{"name":"Lidar","tagline":"Computational Geometry Final Project","body":"Tim Fratangelo & Bret Minnehan\r\n\r\n# Goal\r\nUse unstructured three dimensional point cloud data taken from an aerial vehicle to generate a mesh representing the ground plane.\r\n\r\n# Timeline\r\n* Week 6 - Gain a basic understanding of the PCL library, run though a few sample point cloud datasets.\r\n* Week 7 - Test out the builtin mesh generation, filtering and visualization features of PCL. Create a very rudimentary segmentation of the ground plane by hand.\r\n* Week 8 - First presentation, show before and after filtering, mesh generation and the target ground plane mesh.\r\n* Week 9 - Research and experiment with different segmentation techniques, focusing on graph cuts.\r\n* Week 10 - Implement the chosen segmentation algorithm and begin researching on the ways to determine the ground plane.\r\n* Week 11 - Continue researching and implementing ground plane detection.\r\n* Week 12 - Integration of the full pipeline\r\n* Week 13 - Testing/Integration, write final paper\r\n* Week 14 - Testing/Integration, write final paper\r\n* Week 15 - Final presentation","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
