{"name":"Ground Plane Segmentation from Unstructured Point Clouds","tagline":"Tim Fratangelo & Bret Minnehan","body":"# Description\r\nThe aim of this project is generate a the 3D mesh of the ground plane segmented from an unstructured three dimensional point cloud data taken from an aerial vehicle. We plan on a multistage approach consisting of filtering, segmentation and three dimensional mesh generation. Mean filtering will be used to reduce the inherent Gaussian white noise found in LIDAR data sets. Segmentation research will be focused mainly on the graph cuts approach as proposed by Boykov et al.. In the final stage the segmented ground point cloud will be made into a 3D mesh using an algorithm based on the work by Scheidegger et al.  \r\n______________\r\n# Timeline\r\n### Week 6 \r\n- Gain a basic understanding of the PCL library, run though a few sample point cloud datasets. (Both) \r\n\r\n### Week 7 \r\n- Test out the builtin features of the PCL library:\r\n  - mesh generation (Tim)\r\n  - filtering (Bret) \r\n  - visualization (Both)\r\n- Create a very rudimentary segmentation of the ground plane by hand. (Both)\r\n\r\n### Week 8 \r\n- First presentation, show before and after filtering, mesh generation and the target ground plane mesh. (Both)\r\n\r\n### Week 9 \r\n- Research and experiment with different segmentation techniques, focusing on graph cuts. (Both)\r\n\r\n### Week 10 \r\n- Implement the chosen segmentation algorithm (Bret) \r\n- Begin researching on the ways to determine the ground plane. (Tim)\r\n\r\n### Week 11 \r\n- Continue researching and implementing ground plane detection. (Both)\r\n\r\n### Week 12 \r\n- Integration of the full pipeline (Both)\r\n\r\n### Week 13 \r\n- Testing/Integration (Bret)\r\n- Write final paper (Tim)\r\n\r\n### Week 14 \r\n- Testing/Integration (Tim)\r\n- Write final paper (Bret)\r\n\r\n### Week 15 \r\n- Final presentation\r\n\r\n# Libraries\r\n[PCL](http://docs.pointclouds.org/trunk/index.html)\r\n\r\n[VTK](http://vtk.org/)\r\n# Datasets\r\n[RIT Imaging Science One](http://dirsapps.cis.rit.edu/3d-rochester/data.html)\r\n\r\n[RIT Imaging Science Two](http://www.rit.edu/cos/share2012/downloadarea.php)\r\n\r\n# References\r\n[On the Segmentation of 3D LIDAR Point Clouds\r\n](http://www.velodynelidar.com/lidar/hdlpressroom/pdf/papers/journal_papers/On%20the%20Segmentation%20of%203D%20LIDAR%20Point%20Clouds.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Min-Cut Based Segmentation of Point Clouds](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~funk/s3dv09.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Segmentation of LIDAR Point Clouds For Building Extraction](http://www.asprs.org/a/publications/proceedings/baltimore09/0101.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Automatic 3D Building Detection and Modeling from Airborne LiDAR Point Clouds](http://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/960/)\r\n\r\n[Triangulating Point Set Surfaces with Bounded Error](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~shachar/Publications/MLSMesh.pdf)\r\n\r\n[An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Vision](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~yuri/Papers/pami04.pdf)\r\n\r\n[3D Segmentation of Unstructured Point Clouds for Building Modeling](http://www.pf.bgu.tum.de/isprs/pia07/puba/PIA07_Dorninger_Nothegger.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Modeling 3D Urban Areas from Aerial LIDAR Point Clouds: A Robust Roof Feature Based Reconstruction Approach\r\n](http://www.cis.rit.edu/~sxs4643/jstar_manu.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Aerial 3D Building Detection and Modeling From Airborne LiDAR Point Clouds](http://www.cis.rit.edu/~sxs4643/IEEEsun1.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Triangulating Point Set Surfaces with Bounded Error](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~shachar/Publications/MLSMesh.pdf)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
