{"name":"Ground Plane Segmentation from Unstructured Point Clouds","tagline":"Tim Fratangelo & Bret Minnehan","body":"# Description\r\nUse unstructured three dimensional point cloud data taken from an aerial vehicle to generate a mesh representing the ground plane. We plan on a multistage approach consisting of filtering, segmentation and three dimensional mesh generation. Mean filtering will be used to reduce the inherent white noise found in LIDAR data sets. Segmentation research will be focused mainly on the graph cuts approach. \r\n______________\r\n# Timeline\r\nWeek 6 \r\n- Gain a basic understanding of the PCL library, run though a few sample point cloud datasets. (Both) \r\n\r\nWeek 7 \r\n- Test out the builtin features of the PCL library:\r\n  - mesh generation (Tim)\r\n  - filtering (Bret) \r\n  - visualization (Both)\r\n- Create a very rudimentary segmentation of the ground plane by hand. (Both)\r\n\r\nWeek 8 \r\n- First presentation, show before and after filtering, mesh generation and the target ground plane mesh. (Both)\r\n\r\nWeek 9 \r\n- Research and experiment with different segmentation techniques, focusing on graph cuts. (Both)\r\n\r\nWeek 10 \r\n- Implement the chosen segmentation algorithm (Bret) \r\n- Begin researching on the ways to determine the ground plane. (Tim)\r\n\r\nWeek 11 \r\n- Continue researching and implementing ground plane detection. (Both)\r\n\r\nWeek 12 \r\n- Integration of the full pipeline (Both)\r\n\r\nWeek 13 \r\n- Testing/Integration (Bret)\r\n- Write final paper (Tim)\r\n\r\nWeek 14 \r\n- Testing/Integration (Tim)\r\n- Write final paper (Bret)\r\n\r\nWeek 15 \r\n- Final presentation\r\n\r\n# Libraries\r\n[PCL](http://docs.pointclouds.org/trunk/index.html)\r\n[VTK](http://vtk.org/)\r\n# Datasets\r\n[RIT Imaging Science One](http://dirsapps.cis.rit.edu/3d-rochester/data.html)\r\n[RIT Imaging Science Two](http://www.rit.edu/cos/share2012/downloadarea.php)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
